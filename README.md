ssh-key-generator
=================
A utility for deterministically generating ssh keypairs. PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLY.

Each keypair is generated by hashing together a "seed" or "master key" (should
be at least 32 bytes, randomly generated, and kept secret) and a unique
"handle" (using the same handle will result in the same keypair, but the handle
does not need to be kept secret); the resulting SHA256 hash is used as the
input for generating an Ed25519 keypair.

This allows the creation of a large number of unique keypairs without having to
actually manage the keypairs individually. This allows for, say, using a
different keypair for every host you need to log into, thus preventing someone
from correlating different user accounts on different hosts by the public keys
in authorized_keys.

This proof of concept implementation just generates one keypair at a time;
ideally the keypairs would be generated on demand, perhaps by an SSH agent
implementation (the key generation step should only take a few milliseconds).

Note that while Ed25519 allows for using any 32-byte input to generate a
keypair, making this implementation trivial, implementing a similar scheme for
other key types is probably possible in some cases (eg. ECDSA), and infeasible
in others (DSA/RSA, probably).

Usage
=====
You will need ghc and cabal, as well as the libsodium development files; on
Debian/Ubuntu, the `ghc` and `libsodium-dev` packages are what you need.

```ShellSession
$ git clone https://github.com/mithrandi/ssh-key-generator.git
$ cd ssh-key-generator
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install
$ head -c 32 /dev/urandom > seed
$ cabal run ./seed HIMOM ./id_ed25519
$ ssh-keygen -y -f ./id_ed25519
```

`./seed` is the master key, `HIMOM` is the key handle, and `./id_ed25519` is
the output file into which the private key will be placed. `ssh-keygen` is then
invoked to print the public key out.
